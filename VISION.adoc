= Vision

Smesh's vision is to provide a generalized way for IPC between Java-based (Micro-)services.
Regardless of the internal complexity of Smesh, it should be easy to setup Smesh in one's application.
i.e. no code are required for basic use cases.

== Business aspects

Smesh is designed to be used for small projects, only maintaining a few services, as well as full-fledged enterprise systems,
containing a wide variety of different services and huge clusters.

== Technical aspects

Smesh's modules utilize well-known technologies and enriches them with a generalized way to share available services and their APIs,
either via a centralized service registry or maintaining a client-side registry.
Additionally, Smesh establishes and maintains the respective service cluster.

It is not a goal to create a new IPC-protocol (e.g. https://github.com/google/protobuf[Protobufs]),
but instead rely on established technologies, such as http://www.grpc.io/[gRPC] and https://hazelcast.org/[HazelCast].

== Structural aspects

Technologies backing Smesh's functionality should be interchangeable by switching one Smesh module with another. e.g. smesh-hazelcast with smesh-grpc.
As these technologies are mostly incompatible with each other, it is required that Smesh provides custom interfaces to provide the necessary interchangeability.

== Operational aspects

Smesh's features should be monitorable and configurable at runtime, although the later is no strict requirement,
but rather a recommendation.
